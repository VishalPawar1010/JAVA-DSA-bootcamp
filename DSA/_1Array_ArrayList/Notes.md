1. Why -> to store collections of data types (with same data types)
2. What -> 
3. Syntax -> datatype[] ref_variable_name = new datatype[size];
4. instantiations 

    // store 5 roll nos 
    1. int[] roll-nos = new int[];
    2. int[] roll-nos = {2,4,5,6,7} ;

5. How this thigs are working internally
    1. declaration - int[] nos; // declaration of array nos is getting defined in stack
    2. instantiations - ros = new int[]; // here object is being created in heap

6. For int datatype - default value type is 0
    For string default value is null

7. What is null // its nothing
8. What is ArrayList ? // we only define initial capacity, it can exapnd as needs
9. What is wrapper classes how its diff from datatypes = <Integer> - int
